Just walked out of Plankton: The Movie, and oh boy, if I could sum up my feelings, it’d be like trying to describe the taste of cardboard while standing in a rainstorm. You know, everything was a bit soggy and could've been crispier. The whole thing started off like a toddler learning to walk—awkward, a bit too eager-trying-to-play-smart-for-my-own-good, and yet, oddly delightful when it didn't trip over its own feet. But after a while, it felt like someone poured a jug of lukewarm soup all over my enthusiasm because what was initially charming started feeling like, well, lukewarm soup.

But honestly, I can’t stop thinking about the scene where plankton starts philosophizing about life in the middle of a tsunami like they were the Shakespeare of planktons or something. I guess I needed that kind of existential crisis in the form of microscopic sea life. Unexpected moments of profundity—or maybe just confusion—like a train wreck with zero consequences. My brain is a chaotic jumble of what even was that right now.

> I'm not saying it was terrible; it’s just that the narrative felt like it was munching on gummy worms instead of crafting a coherent storyline. There were these weird moments when I thought, Is this trying to be a documentary or some kind of under-the-sea soap opera? And yet, despite all this, I’d probably still download the movie just to scratch that itch of absurd curiosity.

There’s this hilarious bit where a plankton learns to sing—like, lip-synching in a nightclub kind of sing, which is just next-level absurdity. And that scene where they battle with a freaking current? It was like watching a gang of uncoordinated dancers trying to do an unscripted ballet. I guess it all boils down to the fact that the film was a tornado of randomness, wrapped in a blanket of did that just happen?

Here's where everything derailed for me a little: 

```csharp
public string FindPlanktonHeroOfTheDeep(Plankton hero)
{
   return hero.Name == Mr. Bubbly ? Heroic Plankton : Just Another Plankton;
}
```

Not sure why I even noticed that scene enough to code about it, but maybe the movie scrambled my neurons like an egg on a hot day. And I mean, who honestly doesn’t need a messy, scrambled thought now and again, right? 

Maybe I’ll tell a friend to watch the movie, just for the joy of seeing them wrap their heads around the existential crisis of microscopic sea critters. Or maybe just to warn them before they dive into this wave of plankton madness.
